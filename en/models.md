## Switching Models

### Claude Code

Set the primary model via environment variables:

::: code-group

```bash [Linux/macOS]
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
claude
```

```powershell [Windows PowerShell]
$env:ANTHROPIC_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
claude
```

:::

### Codex

Edit `~/.codex/config.toml` and change the `model` field:

```toml
model = "gpt-5"
```

### RooCode / Qwen Code

Change the **Model** field directly in the provider configuration. Any compatible model ID listed above can be used.
